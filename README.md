# Node-RED SmithTek Node

This is a [Node-RED](http://nodered.org) node used to interact with the SmithTek service.

## Installation -- 
npm install smithtek-nodered-duty-standby or install using pallete manager

The `smithtek-nodered` node for Node-RED is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smithtek-nodered). We recommend
you to read [Node-RED documentation](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/adding-nodes.html#installing-npm-packaged-nodes) if you
have any doubts installing nodes in the platform.

## Usage

There are 4 different nodes: One for controlling the pumps, and 3 for formatting input `msg.payload` into the command format for that controller.
There is also an dadditional GPS node that will parse GPS coordinates in floating point over modbus. Only works with smithtek GPS module, future development 

### Smithtek Duty/Standby Controller

This Node will control two pumps, turning on and off the pumps in a 2 to 1 ratio, with the ability to specify the primary pump. 
The controller will attempt to start a pump and if it doesn't receive a sense flow signal in the specified time out, will attempt to switch pumps.

These are the properties you should configure, by double clicking the node:

* __Flow Sense Delay__: This amount of time to wait for the flow sense signal before switching pumps.
* __Primary Pump__: Which pump is primary (will run twice and then run the secondary once)

#### Commands

There are three commands that this node takes as input.

* __startStop__: This is the command to start and stop the pump. It has the format of:
```
{
  payload: {
    cmd:"startStop",
    value: true/false or 1/0
  }
}
```

* __senseFlow__: This is the command to indicate that flow has been sensed. True indicates flow has been detected. It has the format of:
```
{
  payload:{
    cmd:"senseFlow",
    flow: true/false or 1/0
  }
}
```

* __pumpTrip__: This is the command to lock/clear a pump. True will lock the pump, False will clear the lock. It has the format of:
```
{
  payload:{
    cmd:"pumpTrip",
    value:{
      pump: 1 or 2,
      trip: true/false or 1/0
    }
  }
}
```

#### Outputs
* __pump 1__: Output to control pump 1
* __pump 2__: Output to control pump 2
* __no flow 1__: True indicates no flow detected while running pump 1
* __no flow 2__: True indicates no flow detected while running pump 2

### SmithTek startStop Formatter

This node is used to format the `msg.payload` on the input into the `startStop` command above. 
The incoming payload will become the `value` on the command.

### SmithTek senseFlow Formatter

This node is used to format the `msg.payload` on the input into the `senseFlow` command above. 
The incoming payload will become the `flow` on the command.

### SmithTek pumpTrip Formatter

This node is used to format the `msg.payload` on the input into the `pumpTrip` command above. 
The incoming payload will become the `value.trip` on the command.

These are the properties you should configure, by double clicking the node:

* __Pump Number__: Which pump is this for, it will become the `value.pump` in the output command.

## Development

If you want to modify this extension, you just have to run `npm install` or `yarn install` to fetch and install the dependencies.

To install the development version and use it on your Node-RED instance, you can execute `npm link` on this folder and then execute
`npm link smithtek-nodered` in your `~/.nodered` folder.
